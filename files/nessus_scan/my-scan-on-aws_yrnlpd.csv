This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

No issues were reported with access, privilege, or intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the   remote target may have consistently succeeded with no   privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB   service on the remote target may have failed   intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication   protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of   resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary   from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is   gathered from the target via that protocol and what   particular check failed. For example, consistently   successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux   targets than for Windows targets, and likewise   consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical   for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges
for all planned checks.

Authentication was successful because the authentication protocol service was available remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands on localhost.
