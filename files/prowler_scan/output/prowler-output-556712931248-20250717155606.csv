Routing tablesare used to route network traffic between subnets and to network gateways. It isrecommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to route tables.;CloudWatch is an AWS native service that allows you to ob serve and monitor resources and applications. CloudTrail Logs can also be sent to an external Security informationand event management (SIEM) environment for monitoring and alerting.Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through anexpected path and prevent any accidental or intentional modifications that may lead touncontrolled network traffic. An alarm should be triggered every time an AWS API call isperformed to create, replace, delete, or disassociate a Route Table.;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html;If you are using CloudTrails and CloudWatch, perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription: 1. Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for route table changes and the <cloudtrail_log_group_name> taken from audit step 1. aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name> -- filter-name `<route_table_changes_metric>` --metric-transformations metricName= `<route_table_changes_metric>` ,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{($.eventSource = ec2.amazonaws.com) && (($.eventName = CreateRoute) || ($.eventName = CreateRouteTable) || ($.eventName = ReplaceRoute) || ($.eventName = ReplaceRouteTableAssociation) || ($.eventName = DeleteRouteTable) || ($.eventName = DeleteRoute) || ($.eventName = DisassociateRouteTable)) }' Note: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together. 2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name> Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all monitoring alarms. 3. Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2 aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> - -notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints> Note: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all monitoring alarms. 4.

It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege—that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks instead of allowing full administrative privileges. Providing full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum set of permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to potentially unwanted actions.;;It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.

When virtual MFA is used for root accounts it is recommended that the device used is NOT a personal device but rather a dedicated mobile device (tablet or phone) that is managed to be kept charged and secured independent of any individual personal devices. (non-personal virtual MFA) This lessens the risks of losing access to the MFA due to device loss / trade-in or if the individual owning the device is no longer employed at the company.;;Using IAM console navigate to Dashboard and expand Activate MFA on your root account.
